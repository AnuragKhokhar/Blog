                writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents’ garage in 1976,
                was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in
                1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the
                world’s most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform
                seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones,
                tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus
                belongs in the pantheon of America’s great innovators, along with
                Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a
                saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will
                remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.</p>

                One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of
                the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people.
                “Look at the results,” he replied. “These are all smart people I work
                with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they
                were truly feeling brutalized. But they don’t.” Then he paused for a
                few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got some amazing
                things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the
                past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative
                company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple
                Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention
                every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was
                surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been
                inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four
                children.
